# Sudoky 2: Return of the King

## Description
Sudoky 2 is a revival of an [old repo](https://github.com/VFrancescon/sudoky). 
The goal is as previously to create a program capable of generating and solving sudokus. The solving part must be accomplised without bruteforce and only with techniques a human would employ.

## Plan of action
* No GUI initially: full generating and solving capabilities must be implemented while running in the command line before generating a GUI

* Python: Keeping it to Python3
